# Theme System Design ðŸŽ¨

Before the official launch, we spent time crafting a beautiful theme system that gives each language its own unique visual identity while maintaining consistency across the platform.

## Core Theme Features:

- âœ… **Dark mode by default**: Easier on the eyes for long study sessions
- âœ… **Light mode support**: Full compatibility for all preferences
- âœ… **Flag-inspired colors**: Each language uses colors from its country's flag
- âœ… **Smooth transitions**: Animated theme switching
- âœ… **System preference detection**: Respects user's OS setting

## Language-Specific Themes:

### ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German Theme
- **Colors**: Black, red, gold (from German flag)
- **Accent**: Clean red highlights with subtle yellow touches
- **Feel**: Professional and structured

### ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French Theme
- **Colors**: Blue, white, red (tricolor)
- **Accent**: Elegant blue with red highlights
- **Feel**: Sophisticated and classic

### ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish Theme
- **Colors**: Red and gold (Spanish flag)
- **Accent**: Warm red with golden highlights
- **Feel**: Vibrant and welcoming

## Technical Implementation:

### Context-Based Theme Management
```typescript
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType>();

export function ThemeProvider({ children }: ThemeProviderProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>('dark');
  // Theme logic...
}
```

### CSS Custom Properties
Each language theme injects its own color variables:
```css
--german-primary: #dc2626;
--german-secondary: #f59e0b;
--german-accent: #1f2937;
```

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Consistent across all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Design Philosophy:

**Accessibility First**: High contrast ratios, clear typography, keyboard navigation support.

**Cultural Respect**: Colors and design elements honor each language's cultural heritage.

**Performance**: Minimal CSS, optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions.

The theme system creates an emotional connection between learners and the language they're studying, while maintaining the technical excellence users expect from a modern web application.
